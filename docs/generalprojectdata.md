### Entries into the RentalCal Tool (Input)

You are now in the **input area** of the tool. All entries (exception: Project Description) are directly included in the calculation result.
In the following, different chapters are only used for freehand mode and assisted mode if the input screens differ significantly. If the input screens do not differ or only slightly, the difference is explained in the text.

### General Project Data (Freehand and Assisted Mode)

<ImageCaption src="/img/generalprojectdata.png" caption="Figure 6: Project data"></ImageCaption>

When using the tool for the first time, you will be asked to enter your project details at this point (see Fig. 6). If you would like to be informed about subsequent information and updates, your e-mail address must be provided. It is not necessary to enter a password, as no data is stored on a RentalCal server.
