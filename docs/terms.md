### Terms of Use

The RentalCal Profitability Calculation Tool is provided to you without guaranteeing the correctness and completeness of the software or calculation results. The software, its documentation and the underlying data are provided **free of charge**. The terms of use must be **approved** before using the tool.
The project parties and the European Union shall **under no circumstances be liable** for any loss of data or **any other damage resulting** from the use of such data. No data or images of the tool may be passed on or published to third parties beyond the agreed use. Commercial use is strictly prohibited without the consent of the RentalCal Consortium.

Any use is at your **own risk**. All calculations are based on the data entered by the user or selection of data. No liability is assumed for the actual, exact occurrence of the determined results. The **plausibility** of entered data is checked by the programme only selectively. The **careful and correct input** of data by the user is therefore essential and mandatory. The results of the tool are intended in particular to support, but in no way replace **advice from specialist firms, energy consultants or other experts**. Investment decisions should under no circumstances be made solely on the basis of the calculation results of this software.

Neither the European Commission, nor the RentalCal Consortium, nor its members are obliged to make updates after the end of the project. The tool will be available on the servers of the RentalCal consortium for another 3 years after completion of the project in July 2018.

Funded by the German Government (“Zukunft Bau”) an update of the RentalCal Tool was released in 2022 (v2.0).
