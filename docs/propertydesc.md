### Property Description (Freehand Mode)

In freehand mode the lettable area is the central input data. When entering the lettable area, please note that the programme automatically activates the corresponding input field for your entry. The system first asks for the property type. If an entire building is selected (SFH/TH/MFH or AB) (â†’), the rentable floor space of the building should be registered. Entries for the living space of the apartment are therefore not possible. If a single dwelling (in MFH/AB) is selected as building type, nothing can be entered for the living space of the building. Then an entry is required for the living space of the apartment. Basically, cells with a grey background cannot be described. They are mostly used for the conversion of input values or, as in the above case, are enabled by a corresponding selection. Please enter the area as it is mentioned in the rental agreement with your tenant(s)/rental contract(s).
