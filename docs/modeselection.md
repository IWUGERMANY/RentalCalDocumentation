### Mode Selection

As illustrated in 3.4., the tool is divided into two different streams according to the knowledge and data available for the user. In this screen, the two user groups are explained and data requirements for each mode can be downloaded and printed by clicking the respective buttons. After reading the information you need to choose one mode and continue by clicking on it. You will always see in which **mode you currently are** by looking in the upper right corner.

#### Mode Explanation:

The RentalCal Profitability Calculation Tool offers several approaches to proceed from here, depending on whether an energy concept already exists (for example by an energy consultant's expertise), whether there is a specific building in question (but without a finalised energy concept) or whether the calculation ought to be performed for an exemplary sample building from the TABULA database (TABULA and its follow-up project EPISCOPE attempted to create a typology for buildings in several European countries according to their energy-related properties and to track the progress of energy performance).

#### Assisted Mode:

The assisted mode is based on a selected reference building and a selection of default bundles of measures from TABULA and the RentalCal databases. Default values for energy consumption, average cost figures for measures and energy savings are provided by the tool, which might be overwritten by the user if more accurate information is available. Moreover, the RentalCal consortium has worked out estimations for measure costs which are provided as suggestion values.
This option is especially suitable for users who do not have a specific building in mind, but would like to gain a general insight into the profitability of energy efficiency retrofit in rental housing within different building types, ages and measures across the eight European countries.
This option is intended for landlords who want to perform a profitability calculation for a specific building which does not come close enough to the offered reference buildings and who do not have obtained a complete energy concept (current consumption, bundle of measures and expected savings) yet.

#### Freehand Mode:

The freehand mode is based on an own energy concept without any default values for energy consumption and savings, investment cost or suggestions on the right bundle of measures. If the required input data are available, this option is faster and more precise.
It is especially intended for energy consultants, civil engineers, architects, ownerâ€™s associations and other building professionals who know the technical details and potential costs of the retrofit and want to perform a quick profitability calculation. Moreover, landlords who are consulted by these groups may also use this option.
