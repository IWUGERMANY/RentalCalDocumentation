Default values for energy consumption, average cost figures for measures and energy savings are provided by the tool, which might be overwritten by the user if more accurate information is available. Moreover, the RentalCal consortium has worked out estimations for measure costs which are provided as suggestion values. This option is especially suitable for users who do not have a specific building in mind, but would like to gain a general insight into the profitability of energy efficiency retrofit in rental housing within different building types, ages and measures across the eight European countries. This option is intended for landlords who want to perform a profitability calculation for a specific building which does not come close enough to the offered reference buildings and who do not have obtained a complete energy concept (current consumption, bundle of measures and expected savings) yet.</p><h4 id="freehand-mode" tabindex="-1">Freehand Mode: <a class="header-anchor" href="#freehand-mode" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>The freehand mode is based on an own energy concept without any default values for energy consumption and savings, investment cost or suggestions on the right bundle of measures. If the required input data are available, this option is faster and more precise. It is especially intended for energy consultants, civil engineers, architects, owner\u2019s associations and other building professionals who know the technical details and potential costs of the retrofit and want to perform a quick profitability calculation. Moreover, landlords who are consulted by these groups may also use this option.</p>',6),b='{"title":"Mode Selection","description":"","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":3,"title":"Mode Selection","slug":"mode-selection"}],"relativePath":"modeselection.md","lastUpdated":1659968332997}',c={};function h(u){return(p,f)=>(a(),n("div",null,[s,d,i(t,{src:"/img/modeselection.png",caption:"Figure 5: Mode selection"}),l]))}const y=Object.assign(c,{setup:h});export{b as __pageData,y as default};
