### Tool Structure and Basic Functions

The basic structure and functions of the tool are summarised here (see Fig. 4). The RentalCal Tool was designed for **different user groups** (e. g. energy consultants, real estate owners). The schematic representation of the tool is shown in the diagramme on the right-hand side of the screen (see Fig. 4).
The tool can be run in two different modes. First, the **Assisted Mode** that is intended to serve users with less knowledge about energy efficiency and energy efficiency refurbishments in specific. Secondly, the **Freehand Mode** that give the user more flexibility in the input section, but requires more knowledge.
