### Basic Menu Navigation

The navigation follows common web-based applications and is intuitive to use. The menu or screen area is divided into several areas (see Fig. 2). This allows easy navigation through the software application. To navigate between individual info screens and to correct values, please use the blue buttons ("Continue", "Back") and the red one ("Restore default values") at the bottom of the respective input page (see Fig. 3).

**Section 1:** You can **select the language** (Danish, German, English, French, Polish, Spanish, Czech). The selected language can be seen in the upper right corner of the screen.

**Section 2:** The **tab structure** shows you which topic you are currently working in. The subject areas structure the workflow and represent the central steps of a decision-making process with regard to the implementation of energetic modernisation measures.

**Section 3:** This section displays the entire **subdivision** of the respective tab and the corresponding title of the main screen currently open (see Section 4). The user-friendliness and usability of the tool is supported by the so-called **help box** ("Help"), which you will find at the top of this area. Help can either be opened manually or activated by clicking on the green information fields in the main screen (see Chapter 4.3.). The user manual refers to the help boxes several times (for avoiding duplication). Corresponding places are marked with the following arrow symbol (â†’) in the user manual.

**Section 4:** The **main screen** is primarily designed as an input or output mask for data. The user can only make entries in this area of the screen. Scrolling may be necessary depending on the size of the corresponding input fields. You will recognise this in case you cannot see the "Continue" or "Back" buttons at the bottom of the screen.
