## INTRODUCTION TO THE RENTALCAL TOOL

### Functional Description

This web-based tool is based on a special form of economic efficiency calculation, namely the Visualisation of Financial Implications (VoFi). Especially in this scenario (energy modernisation), it makes it possible to model the economic efficiency in great detail. The calculation is based on the delta approach, which simply includes the change in cash flows in the economic efficiency assessment. In this way, the difference between cash flows before and after the energetic modernisation is considered in the calculation.

In addition to the direct cash flows of the property and the energetic motivations, essential differences to other financial mathematical approaches are that indirect payments can also be modelled. These include in particular the consideration of taxes, depreciation, amortisation and financing. Based on the investment costs of the energy-related modernisation, the return on equity of the investor for the capital employed is thus calculated and presented, considering possible rent increases, subsidy measures, changes in other management costs and much more.

For further information on the investment calculation in general and the calculation of a Visualisation of Financial Implications in particular, please refer to the video tutorial, which can be accessed at http://www.rentalcal.eu/video-tutorial as well as to the information paper "Financial viability of energetic retrofitting" at http://www.rentalcal.eu/summaries-of-rentalcal-reports.

The RentalCal Tool is based on the simple principle of input, processing and output. Data is either entered directly by the user or selected from default values (see below: Databases). The user is guided through the work steps in a structured manner and at the end, the calculation results are presented to the user in a thematically structured and graphically prepared form. It is possible to download the Visualisation of Financial Implications as well as further calculation results in PDF format.
